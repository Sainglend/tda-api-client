Quick Start

Make a request to the User Info & Preferences API's Get User Principals method to retrieve the information found in the javascript example login request below. This can be run directly in the browser console.

    // Utility
    function jsonToQueryString(json) {
        return Object.keys(json).map(function(key) {
                return encodeURIComponent(key) + '=' +
                    encodeURIComponent(json[key]);
            }).join('&');
    }

var userPrincipalsResponse = /*FILL THIS IN - Get User Principals Response at https://developer.tdameritrade.com/user-principal/apis/get/userprincipals-0 with streamerSubscriptionKeys,streamerConnectionInfo in fields*/

    //Converts ISO-8601 response in snapshot to ms since epoch accepted by Streamer
    var tokenTimeStampAsDateObj = new Date(userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.tokenTimestamp);
    var tokenTimeStampAsMs = tokenTimeStampAsDateObj.getTime();

var credentials = {
    "userid": userPrincipalsResponse.accounts[0].accountId,
    "token": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.token,
    "company": userPrincipalsResponse.accounts[0].company,
    "segment": userPrincipalsResponse.accounts[0].segment,
    "cddomain": userPrincipalsResponse.accounts[0].accountCdDomainId,
    "usergroup": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.userGroup,
    "accesslevel": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.accessLevel,
    "authorized": "Y",
    "timestamp": tokenTimeStampAsMs,
    "appid": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.appId,
    "acl": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.acl
}

var request = {
    "requests": [
            {
                "service": "ADMIN",
                "command": "LOGIN",
                "requestid": 0,
                "account": userPrincipalsResponse.accounts[0].accountId,
                "source": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.appId,
                "parameters": {
                    "credential": jsonToQueryString(credentials),
                    "token": userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.token,
                    "version": "1.0"
                }
            }
    ]
}

var mySock = new WebSocket("wss://" + userPrincipalsResponse.streamerInfo.streamerSocketUrl + "/ws"); 

mySock.onmessage = function(evt) { console.log(evt.data); }; mySock.onclose = function() { console.log("CLOSED"); };
 

Then, as a separate command, send:

 

mySock.send(JSON.stringify(request));

1.0 Introduction
Streamer is a TD Ameritrade application that serves streaming market data to internal and external clients of TD Ameritrade.    

To start receiving market data from Streamer, please follow these steps:

Make a HTTP POST request to the User Info & Preferences API's Get User Principals method
Open connection to Streamer Server and subscribe to data.
 

1.1 First Steps
Before client can connect to Streamer for streaming market data, it must first perform a user authentication dialog with TD Ameritrade’s Trading Platform. 

 

1.2 Source ID
This document refers to the OAuth User ID as Source ID

 

1.3 LogIn
This document may refer to LogIn, which refers either to the process of logging in which happens using the Authentication API (see our Getting Started guide) or the information returned which is available in the User Info & Preferences API's Get User Principals method

 

1.4 StreamerInfo
This document may refer to StreamerInfo, which refers to the information available in the User Info & Preferences API's Get User Principals method

 

2.0 Streamer Protocols
Streaming market data can be accessed via the following protocols.  Please note that WebSocket is the recommended protocol for use.  This document will only touch upon the WebSocket protocol and JSON format.

2.1 HTTP
The HTTP protocol provides asynchronous request/streaming communication between client and server.  Requests take the form of an HTTP GET or POST with parameters as required by the type of data requested.  The request opens a connection that returns a continuous stream of data in Java binary format.

Note: If you are using a POST, you must add two newline characters (ASCII 10) to the end of the data being posted.

 

2.2 Websocket
WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.  Once a WebSocket connection is established between the client and the server, all communication will go through this same connection.

 

2.3 HTTP Asynchronous
The HTTP asynchronous protocol with JSON data format is provides streaming data when a client’s browser doesn’t support WebSocket.  It is currently only available to TD Ameritrade tools.

The actives data (field 1) follows this custom format:

 

The data is returned in groups. Each group is delimited by a semicolon ‘;’. The returned groups

are the following (in the order that they are returned:

 

INITIAL GROUP: Descriptor Group. It contains information about the rest of the groups being

returned

If number of groups (not counting the first one) is 2, then:

GROUP 0: Most Active Stocks based on “# of trades”

GROUP 1: Most Active Stocks based on “# of Shares” traded

 

If number of groups (not counting the first one) is 6, then:

GROUP 0: Most Active Stocks based on “Buy # of Trades”

GROUP 1: Most Active Stocks based on “Sell # of Trades”

GROUP 2: Most Active Stocks based on “Buy # of Shares”

GROUP 3: Most Active Stocks based on “Sell # of Shares”
